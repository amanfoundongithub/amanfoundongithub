## Tech Stacks I Have Worked With?
I have worked with following Tech stacks:

- **MEAN** : MongoDB (database), Express.js (Backend), Angular (Frontend) and Node.js (Framework)

### Dart
- **Flutter** : A tech stack developed by Google for fast UI development. I have used this for cross-platform single-codebase projects.

### Java Based Tech Stacks
- **Spring Boot** : Used Spring Boot framework as follows:
  - **Backend Server** : Wrote RESTful API server for frontend applications.
  - **Frontend** : Using Thymeleaf for creating static webpages binded with Java controllers.

### Python
- **Flask** and **FastAPI** : I have used both for developing RESTful APIs. I prefer FastAPI over Flask
due to its more asynchronous and robust nature.
- **Django** : For secure backend applications. Tight coupling made me less interested. 
- **Tkinter** for application design and **Turtle** for rendering graphics.
- Apart from this, I have used **Pytorch** and **Tensorflow** for doing AI/ML related tasks.
- **Gymnasium** for getting Reinforcement-Learning environments.
